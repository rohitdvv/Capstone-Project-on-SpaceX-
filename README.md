#IBM Data Science Professional Certificate Capstone Project: SpaceX Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction

This project is a binary classification problem to predict whether the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully. It is the capstone project for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate.

Data Collection and Preparation

The data for this project was collected from a variety of sources, including the SpaceX API, web scraping, and public datasets. The data was then cleaned and wrangled into a format that could be used for machine learning.

Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was performed to identify patterns and trends in the data. This helped to identify the factors that are most important in predicting successful landings.

Machine Learning Model Development and Evaluation

A variety of machine learning algorithms were evaluated to predict successful landings. The best performing algorithm was a logistic regression model.

Results

The logistic regression model achieved an accuracy of 95% on the held-out test set. This means that the model was able to correctly predict whether a Falcon 9 first stage would land successfully 95% of the time.

Conclusion

The results of this project show that it is possible to accurately predict successful Falcon 9 first stage landings using machine learning. This information can be used by SpaceX to improve its launch operations and reduce costs.

Future Work

This project can be extended in a number of ways. For example, students could collect more data on SpaceX launches, including data on weather conditions and other environmental factors. Students could also try to develop more complex machine learning models to improve the accuracy of the predictions.
